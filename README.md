# Iris Flowers Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their features. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory classification tasks.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to accurately classify the species of an Iris flower based on these features.

The dataset can be obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```

```

2. Download the Iris dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository (`iris_classification.ipynb`) to see the step-by-step process of loading the data, preprocessing it, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.

4. Alternatively, you can run the provided Python script (`iris_classification.py`) using the command:

```
python iris_classification.py

```

## Results

After training the machine learning model, you will see the accuracy achieved on the test dataset. Additionally, the notebook and script provide visualizations of the dataset, feature importance, and potentially decision boundaries, depending on the chosen classifier.
